/* ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Degenerate floats crossing into integers.
 *
 * Converting a float to an integer type is undefined for a NaN and for
 * anything outside the destination range, and the two architectures this
 * core ships on do not agree about what they produce:
 *
 *                   (s32)+inf       (s32)NaN
 *     x86-64         INT32_MIN       INT32_MIN
 *     aarch64        INT32_MAX       0
 *
 * so a draw takes a different path depending on the host. That matters
 * wherever a texel coordinate is computed as S/Q: Q comes straight from
 * the GIF register, and the mixer of substitutions GSState applies does
 * not cover every path -- the fused packed handlers keep the zero-Q
 * FLT_MIN swap but not the NaN one, and FLT_MIN turns a zero Q into an
 * infinite quotient rather than a finite one anyway.
 *
 * These say what happens instead. q_is_usable and f32_to_s32_sat are
 * mirrored on the paraLLEl-GS side, in pgs_vertex_kernels.h, written in
 * C89 for the kernels there; keep those two in step. f32_to_u32_sat has
 * no counterpart there -- paraLLEl-GS converts nothing to u32 on the CPU.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

 * of either sign gives an infinity, and an infinity or a NaN gives a

 *     -1.0          UINT32_MAX  0

 * -1.0 is not an edge case in the sense the others are -- it is a small
 * negative number, in range for a float and out of range only because the
 * destination has no sign. 2^32 is what a normalised depth of exactly 1.0
 * scales to, which is the usual far-plane clear, so it is reached by
 * ordinary content rather than by a malformed draw. */
