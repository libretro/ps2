# No function in the core's own code has a stack frame over 4 KiB, or over
# 2 KiB in libretro-common, which also builds for platforms whose threads
# have small stacks. Every source the core's Makefile builds is compiled
# with its own flags plus -Werror=frame-larger-than; third-party sources
# (3rdparty/, and parallel-gs's Granite and gs) are left out.
#
# The frame sizes are those of this machine's compiler at the Makefile's
# optimisation level: inlining folds a callee's buffers into its caller's
# frame, so a release build is the one to check.
#
# Usage: sh tests/stackframe/build.sh   (MAKE, JOBS optional)
