/* GS local memory: does a transfer come back as what went in?
 *
 * GSLocalMemory addresses the PS2's 4MB of video memory through a
 * swizzle: pixels are not in scanline order but scattered through pages,
 * blocks and columns in a pattern that differs per format. Two families
 * of routine walk it -- the per-pixel accessors, and the transfer
 * routines that move a rectangle at a time and exist because they are
 * faster than calling the per-pixel ones.
 *
 * Nothing checked that a transfer round-trips. That matters because the
 * write side is written per format with hand-computed pitches, and one of
 * them was wrong: WriteImage4HL and WriteImage4HH truncated their source
 * pitch instead of rounding it up, so a width of one gave a pitch of zero
 * and the routine divided by it. That was found by reading, because there
 * was no test that moved any data.
 *
 * So this moves data: for every format it writes a rectangle, reads it
 * back and compares, across a spread of sizes and destination offsets.
 *
 * The two sides do not agree about how a row is packed when a row is not
 * a whole number of bytes, which only arises at 4bpp with an odd width.
 * WriteImage's pitch is ceil(w * bpp / 8) per row -- padded -- while
 * ReadImageX walks len * 2 pixels as one continuous run. That is a real
 * difference rather than a bug in either: at an odd width the fast write
 * paths refuse the transfer (they need the width page-aligned) and fall
 * through to WriteImageX, which packs the way ReadImageX does. The
 * round-trip below therefore runs over the sizes where the two
 * conventions provably coincide, and the odd 4bpp widths are probed
 * separately, reporting what they do rather than asserting what they
 * should.
 *
 * The 4MB block is mapped four times over, as the emulator maps it,
 * because a routine that runs off the end wraps rather than faulting. A
 * plain allocation would turn silent corruption into a crash and answer a
 * different question than the one being asked.
