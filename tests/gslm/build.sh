# GS local memory, with real data moved through it.
#
# GSLocalMemory is the swizzle: the PS2's 4MB of video memory addressed
# through pages, blocks and columns, in a pattern that differs per format.
# Two families of routine walk it -- per-pixel accessors, and transfer
# routines that move a rectangle at a time because they are faster than
# calling the per-pixel ones a million times.
#
# Nothing checked that the two agree. The transfer routines are written
# per format with hand-computed pitches, and the read side of PSMT4 was
# missing the increment of its destination pointer, so every local-to-host
# transfer of 4-bit indexed data wrote one byte and left the rest of the
# buffer alone. Reading found the 4HL/4HH pitch bug next door to it and
# walked straight past this one, because this one is an absent line rather
# than a wrong one. Upstream PCSX2 has it too.
#
# So the harness moves data and compares it. It links the real
# GSLocalMemory, GSTables, GSBlock and the multi-ISA transfer routines,
# which is nearly the whole of the swizzle and none of the renderer.
#
# Two things have to be stubbed. GSClut is held by value inside
# GSLocalMemory, so its constructor must exist, but the real one reaches
# the render device; the swizzle paths never touch the palette, so an
# empty pair is honest. And the 4MB block is mapped four times over, as
# the emulator maps it -- a plain allocation would turn the silent
# wraparound the emulator relies on into a fault and answer a different
# question.
