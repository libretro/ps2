# IPU slice decoder harness.
#
# Drives real MPEG-2 slices -- encoded by ffmpeg -- through the decoder and
# compares each macroblock against ffmpeg's own decode of the same frame.
# That covers the macroblock address increment, the coded block pattern,
# the intra VLC tables, the dequantiser, the scan order, DC prediction and
# the inverse DCT, none of which synthetic blocks can reach.
#
# The comparison is a bound, not an equality: the two decoders use
# different inverse DCTs and the gap tracks high-frequency content. A flat
# frame comes out bit-exact, a gradient sits under half a step, detailed
# frames run 4 to 5 mean. Bit-exactness against this tree is the hash.
#
# The fixtures are committed, so the check does not depend on the local
# ffmpeg matching the one they were made with. Regenerate them only when
# the fixture set should change:
#     ./make_stream_fixtures.py     (needs ffmpeg)
#
#   ./slice_build.sh            check against the pinned hash
#   ./slice_build.sh --print    print the hash to re-pin
