# What the C units and the C++ units expect of each other's symbols.
#
# Two link failures have reached a delivered patch this way, and a compile
# check cannot see either of them:
#
#   - a C unit calls a function whose only definition is C++-mangled,
#     because the header declaring it has no extern "C". Both sides compile;
#     every call site fails at link. (SaveState_FreezeMem, then
#     vu0ExecMicro/_vu0FinishMicro/intDoBranch.)
#
#   - a C unit defines something the header gives internal linkage in C++
#     and external linkage in C -- a bare `const u32`, a bare `inline`
#     function -- so the second C unit including that header defines it
#     again and the link fails on the duplicate. (EELOAD_START and its
#     three neighbours, count_leading_zero.)
#
#   - a C unit references a VARIABLE whose declaration has C++ language
#     linkage. This one is invisible here however hard you look at the
#     symbols: the ELF ABI does not decorate data symbols, so `psxRegs`
#     is spelled `psxRegs` either way and the link succeeds. MSVC
#     decorates them -- ?psxRegs@@3UpsxRegisters@@A -- so the C unit's
#     undecorated reference resolves to nothing and only the Windows lane
#     fails. Twenty-one symbols did, at once. So that class is checked
#     against the source instead: every data symbol a C object needs and
#     a C++ object defines gets its declaration redeclared extern "C" in
#     a probe TU, and C++ language linkage shows up as a conflict.
#
# Both are about symbols, so this compares symbols. Every .c in the tree is
# built, then every .cpp that builds here, and then:
#
#   1. no global symbol may be defined by two C objects, and
#   2. every symbol a C object leaves undefined must be defined somewhere
#      unmangled -- if the only match is a mangled one, the declaration the
#      C side saw and the definition the C++ side emitted disagree.
#
# The C++ half is built at -O0: this is about which symbols exist and how
# they are spelled, not about codegen. Expect a couple of minutes.
#
# The GS backends need SDK headers that are not always present. They are
# skipped, which is sound here because no C unit reaches them -- if one ever
# does, its symbols show up as findings rather than silence.
