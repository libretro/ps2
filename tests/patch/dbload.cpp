/*  The whole game database, through the real parser.
 *
 *  Companion to dbparse.cpp, which covers the patch lines. This covers
 *  everything else in bin/resources/GameIndex.yaml: the game fixes, speed
 *  hacks, GS hardware fixes, rounding and clamping modes and the memory
 *  card filters.
 *
 *  The failure it exists to catch is the same one that hid the "bytes"
 *  operand size. A name the parser does not recognise is reported with a
 *  console error and then dropped -- the entry loses its fix and the game
 *  quietly misbehaves, with nothing failing and nothing to notice. A
 *  rename on either side of the database, or a fix removed from the enum
 *  while entries still ask for it, looks exactly like that.
 *
 *  So this parses every entry and requires no errors and no warnings. It
 *  links pcsx2/GameDatabase.cpp and the real YAML reader rather than
 *  reimplementing either.
 *
 *  What it catches, checked by corrupting the database and re-running:
 *  renaming a gamefix so the parser no longer knows it -- "XGKickHackk"
 *  -- is reported and fails the run. That is the WRC-class failure, a
 *  name in the database that the code has stopped recognising.
 *
 *  What it does not catch, and both are worth knowing:
 *    - a renamed key. Changing "speedHacks:" to "speedHackss:" makes the
 *      whole block invisible and the parser says nothing, because an
 *      unrecognised key is skipped rather than reported. Every entry
 *      under it is silently lost.
 *    - an out-of-range value. "autoFlush: 99" loads without complaint;
 *      the numeric gsHWFixes are range-checked nowhere.
 *
 *  Both are real silent failures this does not close. Catching them means
 *  the parser reporting unknown keys and validating ranges, which is a
 *  change to GameDatabase.cpp rather than to a test.
 *
 *  Usage: tests/patch/dbload <path-to-GameIndex.yaml>
