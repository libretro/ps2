# Who drains the GS ring when a thread waits on it.
#
# pcsx2/MTGSOwner.h is the rule MTGS::WaitGS uses; this runs it with the
# threads a frontend has under threaded video -- a video thread that
# opens the GS and resumes the EE, an EE already waiting before the first
# retro_run, a frontend whose first act is to wait too -- on the real
# work eventcount. The two rules it replaced are built as well and must
# fail: one hangs at startup, the other runs the GS on the EE.
