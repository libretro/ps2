# Headers that both languages read, on every target the core ships on.
#
# A header reachable from a .c file has to compile as C89 *and* as C++, and
# the two are easy to drift apart: a bare `struct Foo` used as a type name, a
# reference parameter, an alignas, a std:: declaration that crept in. None of
# those fail the C++ build, so nothing notices until a C unit includes the
# header -- by which time the fix is a cascade rather than a line.
#
# The set of headers is derived, not listed: every header a C unit pulls in,
# by the compiler's own dependency output. A hand-kept list missed
# SingleRegisterTypes.h and VUmicro.h, which is how COP2.c came to break
# every aarch64 lane and the MSVC one at once.
#
# Every header is compiled on its own, from C and from C++, with nothing
# included ahead of it: a header that only works when something else was
# included first is not self-sufficient, and that is how R5900.h came to
# depend on its includer for u32.
#
# Then the same for aarch64, under both front ends, when the cross tools
# are installed. The headers carry an arch-conditional half -- NEON in
# SingleRegisterTypes.h -- that an x86 pass never opens, and CI reaches it
# with four different compilers: GNU on Linux and webOS aarch64, clang on
# Android arm64 and Apple clang on macOS arm64. gcc and clang disagree
# often enough to be worth both. The C units are cross-compiled whole as
# well.
#
# Last, MSVC's C front end. It has a rule gcc and clang do not enforce even
# with -pedantic-errors: a static-storage initializer must be a constant
# expression, and in C a const object is not one. So
#
#   static const uint VU0_MEMMASK = VU0_MEMSIZE - 1;
#
# is an error there and nowhere else. No local compiler reproduces it:
# clang's MSVC target would, but it needs a Windows SDK for even assert.h,
# so there is none here. Instead the preprocessed C view of each header is
# searched for that spelling. The C spelling is a macro or an enum.
#
# So MSVC is the one lane with no real front end behind it. That rule is
# the only MSVC-specific breakage seen so far; anything else it rejects
# still reaches CI unchecked.
