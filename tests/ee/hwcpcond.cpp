/*  DMAC CPCOND0 against console captures.
 *
 *  Scores CPCOND0 in pcsx2/COP0.cpp against ps2autotests
 *  tests/dma/dmac/cpcond.expected, which nothing read.
 *
 *  CPCOND0 is the signal the EE's BC0F and BC0T branch on, and it is a
 *  pure function of two DMAC registers: it is set when every channel the
 *  program is watching has raised its interrupt, which the hardware
 *  computes as
 *
 *      ((STAT.CIS | ~PCR.CPC) & 0x3FF) == 0x3FF
 *
 *  -- a channel contributes only if PCR.CPC selects it, and an unselected
 *  channel reads as already satisfied. That is why the signal starts set
 *  with PCR clear: nothing is being watched, so the condition is
 *  vacuously true.
 *
 *  The capture walks six states, and the interesting ones are the pair
 *  either side of the DMA: selecting channel 9 in PCR drops the signal
 *  because that channel has not finished, and the transfer raising
 *  STAT.CIS9 brings it back. Clearing PCR again leaves it set for the
 *  same vacuous reason as the start, and restoring PCR leaves it set
 *  because CIS9 is still latched -- writing CIS9 back is what finally
 *  clears it, since STAT bits are acknowledged by writing one.
 *
 *  Usage: tests/ee/hwcpcond
