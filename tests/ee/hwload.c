/*  EE aligned loads against console captures.
 *
 *  Scores LB, LBU, LH, LHU, LW, LWU, LD and LQ against ps2autotests
 *  tests/cpu/ee/lsu.expected, using the semantics in
 *  pcsx2/R5900OpcodeImpl.cpp.
 *
 *  The harness reads from a fixed 48-byte pattern with the base pointer
 *  at its middle row, so offsets run from -16 to +16 and the memory is
 *  fully known:
 *
 *      -16  45678123 9ABCDEF0 DEADBEEF C0DE1337
 *        0  23456789 ABCDEF01 BEEFDEAD C0DEC0DE     <- base
 *      +16  8899AABB CCDDEEFF 00112233 44556677
 *
 *  rt is the destination and carries between cases the same way rd does
 *  in alu.expected -- SET_U32 writes only its low half, SET_M writes all
 *  128 bits from C_GARBAGE1 -- so this walks the file in order and tracks
 *  it. Everything but LQ writes only the low doubleword, and LQ writes
 *  all four words, which is worth checking rather than masking off: it is
 *  the one op here whose upper half should change.
 *
 *  The unaligned pairs (LWL/LWR, LDL/LDR) print two ops per line and are
 *  not covered here.
 *
 *  Usage: tests/ee/hwload <path-to-lsu.expected>
