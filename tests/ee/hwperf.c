/*  EE performance counters against console captures.
 *
 *  Scores the register decode in pcsx2/COP0.cpp against ps2autotests
 *  tests/cpu/ee_cop0/performance.expected, the last capture file in the
 *  cpu tree that nothing read.
 *
 *  The counters are reached through MFC0 and MTC0 on register 25, with
 *  the instruction's immediate choosing which of the four registers is
 *  meant. That decode is what this scores, and it is all pure function of
 *  the immediate:
 *
 *    bit 0 clear -> PCCR, the control register; set -> one of the two
 *    counters, chosen by bit 1;
 *    a write to PCCR is only effective when the rest of the specifier is
 *    zero, so MTPS with any register other than 0 is a no-op;
 *    a read of PCCR ignores the specifier entirely.
 *
 *  The capture's last four lines are about the counters actually
 *  counting -- whether pcr0 changes when its mode bits are set -- which
 *  needs cycles to pass and a running emulator. Those are not scored
 *  here, and saying so is the point: this file covers the decode and not
 *  the counting.
 *
 *  Usage: tests/ee/hwperf
