/*  The worker-notify handshake in pcsx2/WorkEventCount.h.
 *
 *  This is what replaced common/Threading.h's WorkSema class: two
 *  libretro-common eventcounts and three ints that MTGS and MTVU embed and
 *  drive through free functions. The seven operations keep the contract
 *  the class had, and MTGS and MTVU depend on it exactly, so this pins
 *  each part:
 *
 *    1. NotifyOfWork then CheckForWork returns true once, then false.
 *    2. WaitForWork returns at once when work is pending.
 *    3. WaitForWork parks with nothing pending and wakes on notify.
 *    4. WaitForEmpty returns only after the worker has consumed every
 *       notify so far and gone idle -- including a notify that lands
 *       between the worker's last check and its park.
 *    5. WaitForWorkTimed returns false only on a timeout with nothing
 *       pending, true whenever work arrived.
 *    6. Kill makes every wait return and WaitForEmpty report false;
 *       Reset revives.
 *    7. A producer/consumer pair run hard, with WaitForEmpty interleaved,
 *       loses no wake and never sees WaitForEmpty return while work is
 *       outstanding.
 *
 *  Run under TSan: the two threads share nothing but the primitive.
 *
 *  As with every eventcount test in this series, the lost-wake half of 7
 *  is only load-bearing on more than one core.
