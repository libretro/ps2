# MMI divide checks.
#
# Two things, cheapest first:
#
#   divsign.sh   reads the recompiler sources and checks that every CDQ is
#                followed by an IDIV and every zeroing of EDX by a DIV.
#                Catches the PDIVW/PDIVBW bug by inspection, at review
#                speed, without building anything.
#
#   divcheck.c   emits the guarded divide sequences through the same
#                macros the recompiler uses, executes them, and compares
#                against pcsx2/MMI.cpp. Catches the same bug by running
#                it: a sign-extended dividend fed to an unsigned divide
#                either returns the wrong quotient or raises #DE, and the
#                second of those takes the process down with SIGFPE.
