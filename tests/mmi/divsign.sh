# Divide-signedness check for the x86 EE/IOP recompilers.
#
# Every hand-built divide in the recompilers is a guard chain followed by
# a two-instruction tail: CDQ then IDIV for a signed divide, or
# XOR EDX,EDX then DIV for an unsigned one. Pairing a CDQ with a DIV
# sign-extends the dividend into EDX and then reads the result as
# unsigned, which returns a wrong quotient for most operands and raises
# #DE when the quotient will not fit in 32 bits. PDIVW and PDIVBW were
# written that way and it survived a long time, because the failure is
# quiet until a dividend goes negative.
#
# The two sequences are adjacent lines in every emitter here, so this
# checks exactly that: a cdq must be followed by an idiv, and a
# zeroing of EDX must not be followed by one.
#
# Usage: sh tests/mmi/divsign.sh   (from anywhere). Non-zero on a mismatch.
