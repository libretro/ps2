 * Native taps for a texture at native size (the PS_NATIVE_TAPS branch of
 * the hardware renderer's pixel shaders: DX11/tfx.fx, which DX12 builds
 * too, OpenGL/tfx_fs.glsl and Vulkan/tfx.glsl).
 *
 * A bilinear read at scale takes the native pixel's two taps, a native
 * texel apart, with the native pixel's weights. From a target at the same
 * scale each fragment reads its own sample of each tap's texel. A texture
 * at native size has no samples within a texel, and the fragment's place
 * in the pixel, added the same way, carried the right fragments of a pixel
 * across into the next texel: a screen composed for the 2x2 average of a
 * read at texel edges, text and all, came out with each tap half a texel
 * along over half the pixel.
 *
 * The shaders are strings in C++ files, so the arithmetic is modelled here
 * with the expression as each shader carries it, and each shader file is
 * checked to carry it.
