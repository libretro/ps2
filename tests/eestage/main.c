/* The interpreter's execution stages survive a cancelled instruction.
 *
 * The EE interpreter runs a boot in stages: from reset until the BIOS's
 * EELOAD main, then until the game's entry point, then the game, each
 * stage watching for the addresses that end it. A load or store at a
 * misaligned address cancels its instruction by jumping back to the top
 * of the execution loop, and the loop must carry on in the stage it was
 * in: a game resumed in the reset stage has its jumps through EELOAD's
 * main taken for a new boot, and on arm64 it would lose the recompiler,
 * which runs in the game stage only.
 *
 * Driven on the real Interpreter.cpp and R5900OpcodeImpl.cpp: a boot that
 * reaches EELOAD main once, enters the game, does a misaligned load, then
 * jumps through EELOAD main again on its way out. EELOAD main must have
 * been hooked once, and the cancelled load must have left its register
 * as it was.
 * C89. */
