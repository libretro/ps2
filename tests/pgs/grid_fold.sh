# A change to the paraLLEl-GS rasterizer shaders must leave the code of
# every grid it does not touch as it was.
#
# ubershader.comp and triangle_setup.comp are specialised on the grid
# (constants 0 and 1, the log2 sample counts across and down), and
# sample_circuit.frag on its sample count (constant 2), so a branch added
# for one grid should fold away for the others. This builds the shaders
# from the tree and from a git ref (origin/master unless given), freezes
# the grid constants to each grid the renderer offers, optimises, and
# compares the two builds in canonical form (pgs_spv_canon.c: ids
# renumbered by first use, declarations sorted). Every grid must come out
# identical, except those named in EXPECT_DIFFERENT (as "xy" pairs, comma
# separated, for every shader, or "shader:xy" for one of ubershader,
# triangle_setup and sample_circuit), which must not: for a change that
# adds a grid, naming it is the control that the comparison can see a
# change at all.
