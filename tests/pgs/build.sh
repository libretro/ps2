#
# pgs_layout_check  : the shared structs must keep the exact sizes and
#                     offsets the precompiled shader bank was built against.
# pgs_c89_check     : the kernel header must compile as strict C89.
# pgs_field_scanout : the high-res scanout factors of field-rendered games
#                     and the sample layers the circuit shader reads for them.
# pgs_scanout_exec  : the shipped scanout circuit drawn on a Vulkan device
#                     (llvmpipe will do) over a VRAM of known contents,
#                     every output pixel against that sample-layer model,
#                     the tent reconstruction included.
# pgs_ss_copies     : which texture reads carry super samples without the
#                     full super-sampled textures option, and the embedded
#                     triangle_setup built with the switch that selects them.
# pgs_empty_instance : a render pass flushed with an empty last instance
#                     sizes only the instances with a bounding box.
# pgs_palette_samples : a palette read of a super-sampled texture takes the
#                     texel's own sample, as neighbouring texels of an 8-bit
#                     view are other bytes.
# pgs_vertex_oracle : the C89 kernels must write bytes identical to the
#                     muglm field-by-field bodies they replace.
# pgs_queue_equiv   : a ring-buffer vertex queue must deliver the same
#                     (position, attribute) triples to drawing_kick_append
#                     as the shift queue, for every topology.
# pgs_prim_record_equiv : the cached per-primitive record must equal one
#                     rebuilt from the registers every primitive -- a register
#                     writer that forgets its dirty bit shows up here.
# pgs_parallelogram_equiv : the scalar rewrite of the two gs_util predicates
#                     must agree with the muglm form, float path included --
#                     NaN, +/-0 and infinity all appear in the inputs.
# pgs_kick_bench    : ns/vertex per candidate.
# pgs_bank_splice   : puts a rebuilt SPIR-V module back into the shader
#                     bank, or takes one out; checked here by a splice that
#                     replaces nothing.
# pgs_spv_canon     : canonical form of a SPIR-V disassembly, for
#                     grid_fold.sh, which checks a shader change leaves the
#                     other grids' folded code as it was.
#
# Everything above runs on x86 and again on aarch64 under qemu, because the
# pair kernels branch on the host ISA and the NEON arm is the one the core's
# main target takes.
#
# Everything runs under BOTH g++ and clang++. The two disagree about which
# field they compile well -- gcc rebuilds the packed UV in six instructions
# where clang uses two, clang splits the ST pair into two moves where gcc
# merges them -- so a number from one compiler decides nothing here.
