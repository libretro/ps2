/* Table indices in GSdx that come from GS register fields.
 *
 * A game writes GS registers directly, so a register bitfield is fully
 * controlled within its declared width, and some paths map a field
 * through an enum or a subtraction before using it as a subscript. An
 * index out of range is an out-of-bounds read, not merely undefined
 * arithmetic, so the interesting question for each is whether the
 * field's whole range lands inside the table.
 *
 * A field whose width exactly matches the table is safe by construction
 * and needs nothing -- a 2-bit PRIM.CTXT into CTXT[2], a 6-bit PSM into
 * m_psm[64]. What this pins is the three places where it does not match,
 * over every value the fields can hold, including the values that used
 * to land outside.
