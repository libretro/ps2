/*  VU0 macro-mode control register writes against console captures.
 *
 *  ps2autotests tests/cpu/vu0_macro/transfer.expected writes 0xffffffff
 *  to each VI control register with CTC2 and reads it back with CFC2, so
 *  each line is that register's writable mask. This scores the CTC2 and
 *  CFC2 semantics in pcsx2/VU0.cpp against them.
 *
 *  Only the masking is modelled. The registers whose writes have side
 *  effects beyond the store -- FBRST resetting a VU, CMSAR1 kicking off a
 *  VU1 microprogram -- are scored on the value they leave behind, which
 *  is what the capture prints; the side effects themselves need the
 *  emulator running and are out of scope here.
 *
 *  Six of the sixteen match, and this asserts that as a floor rather than
 *  demanding all sixteen, because the other ten are a known gap and not
 *  one to close casually. We store the written value whole where the
 *  hardware keeps only some bits of it -- the status flag reads back
 *  0x00000fc0, the clipping flag 0x00ffffff, CMSAR0 and VI01 sixteen bits,
 *  the three reserved registers various fixed values -- and FBRST goes the
 *  other way, reading back zero on console while we deliberately keep
 *  0x0c0c because the VU1 stall logic reads those bits back out.
 *
 *  Note also that a single write of all-ones cannot tell a write mask from
 *  a read mask; it only shows what survives the round trip. Closing any of
 *  these properly means knowing which end does the masking, and for the
 *  registers the emulator itself reads back that distinction decides
 *  whether internal users see the masked value too.
 *
 *  Usage: tests/vu/hwctc2 <path-to-transfer.expected>
