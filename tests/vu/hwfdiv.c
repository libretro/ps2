/*  VU FDIV latencies against console captures.
 *
 *  Scores the Q-pipeline latency our interpreter uses for DIV, SQRT and
 *  RSQRT (the `cycles` fields in _vuRegsDIV, _vuRegsSQRT and _vuRegsRSQRT
 *  in pcsx2/VUops.cpp) against ps2autotests
 *  tests/vu/lower/fdivdelay.expected.
 *
 *  The capture's "single delayed" sections issue the divide and then a run
 *  of MULq writing VF01, VF02, ... in turn, so the index of the first VF
 *  holding the new Q value *is* the latency, read directly off the
 *  hardware. The file is parsed for that index rather than the numbers
 *  being transcribed, so the expectation cannot drift from the capture.
 *
 *  This deliberately does not model the pipeline. The rest of
 *  fdivdelay.expected covers stalls, branches and back-to-back divides,
 *  which need a real model of the FDIV stage and its interaction with
 *  WAITQ; scoring those wants a pipeline simulator rather than a constant
 *  check. What this pins is the single number each of those behaviours is
 *  built on, and which is easy to change while "improving" timing.
 *
 *  Usage: tests/vu/hwfdiv <path-to-fdivdelay.expected>
