/* MTVU ring pointer protocol, modelled exactly, hammered concurrently.
 *
 * This now models the FIXED protocol, which MTVU.cpp carries; FIXED=0
 * builds the one it replaced, which fails in a few thousand packets.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR
 *
 * MTVU.cpp's WaitOnSize carries a FIXME: "there is a bug somewhere in
 * the queue pointer management. It creates a deadlock/corruption in SotC
 * intro. I added a 4KB safety net which seem to avoid to trigger the
 * bug. Note: a wait lock instead of a yield also helps to avoid the
 * bug." The safety net is still there and the yield is still there, and
 * between them the EE thread spins instead of parking whenever MTVU
 * falls behind -- on a four-thread machine, stealing cycles from the
 * very thread it is waiting for.
 *
 * The bug reproduces in one game's intro, which is not a thing a test
 * can run. What a test can run is the protocol itself: the ring is a
 * plain linear buffer with an explicit wrap packet, two positions
 * published as atomics, and four decision points. All of it is
 * reproducible without a GS, a BIOS or a disc.
 *
 * THE PROTOCOL, AS THE CODE HAS IT
 *
 *   reader: while (m_ato_read_pos != m_ato_write_pos) { consume; }
 *           publishes m_ato_read_pos after each whole command
 *   writer: ReserveSpace(size):
 *             if (m_write_pos + size > buffer_size - 1)
 *                 WaitOnSize(1); write NULL; m_write_pos = 0; publish
 *             WaitOnSize(size)
 *           WaitOnSize(size):
 *             readPos = m_ato_read_pos
 *             if (readPos <= m_write_pos)                break
 *             if (readPos > m_write_pos + size + 4096)   break
 *             else yield and retry
 *
 * Equality of the two positions means EMPTY to the reader. So the
 * writer must never advance its position onto the reader's, and the
 * 4096 is what keeps it away. This checks that it does:
 *
 *   - every byte the writer puts in is the byte the reader takes out,
 *     in order, with a per-slot sequence number
 *   - the writer never writes into the region between the published
 *     read position and itself
 *   - the two positions never become equal while data is outstanding,
 *     which is the empty/full ambiguity the 4KB hides
 *
 * WITH_GUARD=0 removes the guard band to show what it is protecting
 * against.
 *
 * WHAT IT FINDS
 *
 * The first test is "readPos <= m_write_pos -> break", read as "the
 * reader is behind us, so everything from here to the end is free".
 * When the two positions are equal that reading is one of two
 * possibilities and the other one is the opposite: a ring whose writer
 * has come all the way around onto the reader is full, not empty. The
 * writer takes the empty branch either way, and because that test comes
 * first, the guard band below it is never consulted.
 *
 * So a writer that gets ahead -- at startup, or any time the reader
 * stalls -- writes the whole ring, wraps to 0, finds the reader still
 * at 0, and goes around again. The reader then reads whatever is under
 * it: this harness sees its first packet already carrying sequence
 * number 118424, and a length field that walks it out of the buffer
 * entirely. The emulator has no bounds check there.
 *
 * The guard band narrows the window rather than closing it, which is
 * exactly what "seem to avoid to trigger the bug" describes. A fix has
 * to make full and empty distinguishable -- a count of outstanding
 * words alongside the positions, or a slot that is never written --
 * and the yield in WaitOnSize can become a park once it is.
