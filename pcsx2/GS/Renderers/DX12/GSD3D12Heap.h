/*
 * D3D12 heap memory, taken in blocks and suballocated from there, with
 * resources placed into it. In C.
 *
 * What it replaces is D3D12MemoryAllocator, for the same reasons VMA
 * went from the Vulkan backend: the library decides when to ask the
 * driver for a heap and how big, and those decisions are the ones that
 * put the renderer on the floor. Render targets were being created
 * committed, which is a heap apiece - the D3D12 spelling of Vulkan's
 * dedicated allocation, and the same mistake.
 *
 * The rule here is the same one and it is in one place. Blocks are
 * taken from the device, are large, and are not given back while the
 * heap lives unless a trim finds one empty. An allocation is an offset
 * inside a block, found by walking that block's free list; freeing puts
 * the span back and merges it with its neighbours. The caller places a
 * resource at that offset with CreatePlacedResource.
 *
 * Unlike the Vulkan heap nothing is mapped here: D3D12 maps resources,
 * not heaps, so mapping stays with whoever created the resource.
 *
 * Blocks are segregated by heap type and heap flags together, because
 * on a resource-heap-tier-1 device a heap may hold buffers, or render
 * targets and depth stencils, or other textures, but not a mix. On tier
 * 2 the caller passes ALLOW_ALL_BUFFERS_AND_TEXTURES for everything and
 * they all land in the same blocks.
 *
 * The device calls are passed in rather than linked against, so this
 * file needs no d3d12.h and the arithmetic - the part that decides
 * whether a frame allocates - can be built and run without a GPU.
 *
 * Reserve at startup with gs_d3d12_heap_reserve and the frames that
 * follow ask the device for nothing at all.
 *
 * Not thread safe; the GS is one thread.
