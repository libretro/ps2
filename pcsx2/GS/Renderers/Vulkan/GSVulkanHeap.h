/*
 * Vulkan device memory, allocated in blocks at startup and suballocated
 * from there. In C.
 *
 * What it replaces is the Vulkan Memory Allocator, which is a good
 * library and the wrong shape for this. VMA decides when to ask the
 * driver for a VkDeviceMemory and how big, and those decisions are what
 * put this renderer on the floor: a dedicated allocation per render
 * target until the device ran out of allocation handles, blocks grown
 * on demand in the middle of a frame, and memory freed and re-taken
 * several times a second because the code above it asked for that.
 *
 * Here the rule is in one place and it is simple. Blocks are taken from
 * the driver, are large, and are never given back while the heap lives.
 * An allocation is an offset inside a block, the lowest free span that
 * fits; the free spans are kept sorted, so freeing is a binary search
 * and a merge with the span on either side. A host-visible block is mapped once when it is taken and
 * stays mapped, so nothing maps or unmaps per use either.
 *
 * Reserve at startup with gs_vk_heap_reserve and the frames that follow
 * ask the driver for nothing at all.
 *
 * Not thread safe; the GS is one thread.
