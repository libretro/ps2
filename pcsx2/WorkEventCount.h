/*
 * WorkEventCount - the "tell a worker thread there is new work" handshake,
 * as two libretro-common eventcounts and nothing else.
 *
 * This replaces common/Threading.h's WorkSema class. The state it needs is
 * two eventcounts and three ints, and the caller owns them: an MTGS or an
 * MTVU embeds a WorkEventCount and calls these free functions. There is no
 * pcsx2 wrapper class, no common/ helper, no hand-rolled state machine --
 * the whole point of the move is to call straight into libretro-common.
 *
 * Two directions, each an eventcount:
 *
 *   work  (producer -> worker, "work was added"): retro_asym_eventcount.
 *         Its notify is a release store and a relaxed load, no lock
 *         prefix -- that is what the EE pays per GS packet, and it is the
 *         reason for the whole change. Where retro_procbarrier has no
 *         tier the eventcount runs its symmetric protocol for life,
 *         decided at init; the caller never has to know which.
 *
 *   empty (worker -> producer, "I drained everything so far and went
 *         idle"): the plain retro_eventcount. Read once a frame, so its
 *         cost does not matter, and its prepare/commit contract is what
 *         the old STATE_FLAG_WAITING_EMPTY handshake was reinventing.
 *
 * Contract, matching the class it replaces exactly:
 *   - NotifyOfWork:      publish that work was added.
 *   - CheckForWork:      true once per burst of notifies; a false return
 *                        means the worker is now idle and empty-waiters
 *                        are told so.
 *   - WaitForWork:       return at once with work pending; else spin
 *                        SpinBudget() reads and park -- the one place the
 *                        process-wide barrier is paid.
 *   - WaitForWorkTimed:  as WaitForWork, false only on a timeout with
 *                        nothing pending (true means work or dead).
 *   - WaitForEmpty:      block until the worker consumed every notify so
 *                        far AND went idle; false if the worker is dead.
 *   - Kill / Reset:      dead threads process nothing and make every wait
 *                        return; Reset revives.
